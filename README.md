## Disclaimer

This is the successor to the original [CRIPT Python SDK](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/cript). The new CRIPT Python SDK is still under development, and we will officially release it as soon as it is ready. For now please use the [original CRIPT Python SDK](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/cript)

## What is it?

The CRIPT Python SDK allows programmatic access to the [CRIPT platform](https://criptapp.org). It can help automate uploading your data to CRIPT, and aims to allow for manipulation of your CRIPT data through the python language. This is a perfect tool for users who have python experience and have large amount of data to upload to [CRIPT](https://criptapp.org).
