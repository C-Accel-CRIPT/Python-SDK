    ## Definition

    The [File node](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.3c00011/suppl_file/oc3c00011_si_001
    .pdf#page=28) provides a link to  scholarly work and allows users to specify in what way the work relates to that
    data. More specifically, users can specify that the data was directly extracted from, inspired by, derived from,
