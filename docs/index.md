**CRIPT** (the _Community Resource for Innovation in Polymer Technology_) is a web-based platform for capturing and sharing polymer data. In addition to a user interface, CRIPT enables programmatic access to the platform through the CRIPT Python SDK, which interfaces with a REST API.

CRIPT offers multiple options to upload data, and scientists can pick the method that best suits them. Using the SDK to upload is a great choice if you have a large amount of data, stored it in an unconventional way, and know some python programming. You can easily use a library such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) to parse your data, create the needed CRIPT objects/nodes and upload them into CRIPT.

Another great option can be the [Excel Uploader](https://c-accel-cript.github.io/cript-excel-uploader/) for scientists that do not have past Python experience or would rather easily input their data into the CRIPT Excel Template.

## Disclaimer

!!! Warning "CRIPT Availability"
    Currently, CRIPT is only available for users in the USA, and it is equipped with geo-blocking functionality that restricts access for users outside the USA.

    > We are diligently working towards making CRIPT accessible globally. We appreciate your patience as we strive to achieve this goal!
