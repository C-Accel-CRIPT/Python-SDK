## CRIPT Availability

Currently, CRIPT is only available for users in the USA, and it is equipped with geo-blocking functionality that restricts access for users outside the USA. We are diligently working towards making CRIPT accessible worldwide. We appreciate your patience as we strive to achieve this goal!

## What is it?

The CRIPT Python SDK allows programmatic access to the [CRIPT platform](https://criptapp.org). It can help automate uploading your data to CRIPT, and aims to allow for manipulation of your CRIPT data through the python language. This is a perfect tool for users who have python experience and have large amount of data to upload to [CRIPT](https://criptapp.org).
