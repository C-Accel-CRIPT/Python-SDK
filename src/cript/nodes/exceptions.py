class CRIPTNodeSchemaError(CRIPTException):
    """
    ## Definition
    This error is raised when the CRIPT [json database schema](https://json-schema.org/)
    validation fails for a node.

    Please keep in mind that the CRIPT Python SDK converts all the Python nodes inside the
    [Project](../../nodes/primary_nodes/project) into a giant JSON
    and sends an HTTP `POST` or `PATCH` request to the API to be processed.

    However, before a request is sent to the API, the JSON is validated against API database schema
    via the [JSON Schema library](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
    and if the database schema validation fails for whatever reason this error is shown.

    ### Possible Reasons

    1. There was a mistake in nesting of the nodes
    1. There was a mistake in creating the nodes
    1. Nodes are missing
    1. Nodes have invalid vocabulary
        * The database schema wants something a different controlled vocabulary than what is provided
    1. There was an error with the way the JSON was created within the Python SDK
        * The format of the JSON the CRIPT Python SDK created was invalid
    1. There is something wrong with the database schema

    ## Troubleshooting
    The easiest way to troubleshoot this is to examine the JSON that the SDK created via printing out the
    [Project](../../nodes/primary_nodes/project) node's JSON and checking the place that the schema validation
    says failed

    ### Example
    ```python
    print(my_project.json)
    ```

    ## Definition
    This exception is raised when converting a node from JSON to Python class fails,
    because a node is specified with its UID only, but not part of the data graph elsewhere.

    ### Error Example
    Invalid JSON that cannot be deserialized to a CRIPT Python SDK Node

    ```json
    {
    "node": ["Algorithm"],
    "key": "mc_barostat",
    "type": "barostat",
    "parameter": {"node": ["Parameter"], "uid": "uid-string"}
    }
    ```
    Here the algorithm has a parameter attribute, but the parameter is specified as uid only.

    ### Valid Example
    Valid JSON that can be deserialized to a CRIPT Python SDK Node

    ```json
    {
       "node":["Algorithm"],
       "key":"mc_barostat",
       "type":"barostat",

    Specify the full node instead. This error might appear if you try to partially load previously generated JSON.

        },
        ```


    ## Troubleshooting
    Debugging skills are most helpful here as there is no one-size-fits-all approach.

    It is best to identify whether the invalid JSON was created in the Python SDK
    or if the invalid JSON was given from the API.

    If the Python SDK created invalid JSON during serialization, then it is helpful to track down and
    identify the point where the invalid JSON was started.

    You may consider, inspecting the python objects to see if the node type are written incorrectly in python
    and the issue is only being caught during serialization or if the Python node is written correctly
    and the issue is created during serialization.

    If the problem is with the Python SDK or API, it is best to leave an issue or create a discussion within the
    [Python SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK) for one of the members of the
    CRIPT team to look into any issues that there could have been.
