"""
This conftest file contains simple nodes (nodes with minimal required arguments)
and complex node (nodes that have all possible arguments), to use for testing.

Since nodes often depend on other nodes copying and pasting nodes is not ideal,
and keeping all nodes in one file makes it easier/cleaner to create tests.

The fixtures are all functional fixtures that stay consistent between all tests.
