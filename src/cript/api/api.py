        !!! note "api client context manager"
            It is necessary to use a `with` context manager for the API

        Examples
        --------
        ### Create API client with host and token
        ```Python
        with cript.API(
            host="https://api.criptapp.org/",
            api_token="my api token",
            storage_token="my storage token",
        ) as api:
            # node creation, api.save(), etc.
        ```

        ---

        ### Creating API Client
        !!! Warning "Token Security"
            It is **highly** recommended that you store your API tokens in a safe location and read it into your code
            Hard-coding API tokens directly into the code can pose security risks,
            as the token might be exposed if the code is shared or stored in a version control system.
            Anyone that has access to your tokens can impersonate you on the CRIPT platform

        ### Create API Client with
        [Environment Variables](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-env-vars-how-to-get-an-environment-variable-in-python/)
        Another great way to keep sensitive information secure is by using
        [environment variables](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-env-vars-how-to-get-an-environment-variable-in-python/).
        Sensitive information can be securely stored in environment variables and loaded into the code using
        [os.getenv()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv).

        #### Example

        ```python
        import os

        # securely load sensitive data into the script
        cript_host = os.getenv("cript_host")
        cript_api_token = os.getenv("cript_api_token")
        cript_storage_token = os.getenv("cript_storage_token")

        with cript.API(host=cript_host, api_token=cript_api_token, storage_token=cript_storage_token) as api:
            # write your script
            pass
        ```

        ### Create API Client with None
        Alternatively you can configure your system to have an environment variable of
        `CRIPT_TOKEN` for the API token and `CRIPT_STORAGE_TOKEN` for the storage token, then
        initialize `cript.API` `api_token` and `storage_token` with `None`.

        The CRIPT Python SDK will try to read the API Token and Storage token from your system's environment variables.

        ```python
        with cript.API(host=cript_host, api_token=None, storage_token=None) as api:
            # write your script
            pass
        ```

        ### Create API client with config.json
        `config.json`
        ```json
        {
            "host": "https://api.criptapp.org/",
            "api_token": "I am API token",
            "storage_token": "I am storage token"
        }
        ```

        `my_script.py`
        ```python
        from pathlib import Path

        # create a file path object of where the config file is
        config_file_path = Path(__file__) / Path('./config.json')

        with cript.API(config_file_path=config_file_path) as api:
            # node creation, api.save(), etc.
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        host : str, None
            CRIPT host for the Python SDK to connect to such as https://api.criptapp.org/`
            This host address is the same address used to login to cript website.
            If `None` is specified, the host is inferred from the environment variable `CRIPT_HOST`.
        api_token : str, None
            CRIPT API Token used to connect to CRIPT and upload all data with the exception to file upload that needs
            a different token.
            You can find your personal token on the cript website at User > Security Settings.
            The user icon is in the top right.
            If `None` is specified, the token is inferred from the environment variable `CRIPT_TOKEN`.
        storage_token: str
            This token is used to upload local files to CRIPT cloud storage when needed
        config_file_path: str
            the file path to the config.json file where the token and host can be found


        Notes
        -----
        * if `host=None` and `token=None`
            then the Python SDK will grab the host from the users environment variable of `"CRIPT_HOST"`
            and `"CRIPT_TOKEN"`

        Warns
        -----
        UserWarning
            If `host` is using "http" it gives the user a warning that HTTP is insecure and the user should use HTTPS

        Raises
        ------

        Download a file from CRIPT Cloud Storage (AWS S3) and save it to the specified path.

        ??? Info "Cloud Storage vs Web URL File Download"

            If the `object_name` does not starts with `http` then the program assumes the file is in AWS S3 storage,
            and attempts to retrieve it via
            [boto3 client](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

            If the `object_name` starts with `http` then the program knows that
            it is a file stored on the web. The program makes a simple
            [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) request to get the file,
            then writes the contents of it to the specified destination.

            > Note: The current version of the program is designed to download files from the web in a straightforward
            manner. However, please be aware that the program may encounter limitations when dealing with URLs that
            require JavaScript or a session to be enabled. In such cases, the download method may fail.

            > We acknowledge these limitations and plan to enhance the method in future versions to ensure compatibility
            with a wider range of web file URLs. Our goal is to develop a robust solution capable of handling any and
            all web file URLs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_source: str
            `object_name`: file downloaded via object_name from cloud storage and saved to local storage
            object_name e.g. `"Data/{file_name}"`
            ---
            `URL file source`: If the file source starts with `http` then it is downloaded via `GET` request and
            saved to local storage
           URL file source e.g. `https://criptscripts.org/cript_graph_json/JSON/cao_protein.json`
        destination_path: str
            please provide a path with file name of where you would like the file to be saved

            > If no path is specified, then by default it will download the file

            > The destination path must include a file name and file extension

            Under the hood, this method actually calls
            [delete_node_by_uuid](./#cript.api.api.API.delete_node_by_uuid)
            with the node_type and node UUID

        Warnings
        --------
        After successfully deleting a node from the API, keep in mind that your local Project node in your script
        may still contain outdated data as it has not been synced with the API.

        To ensure you have the latest data, follow these steps:

        1. Fetch the newest Project node from the API using the [`cript.API.search()`](./#cript.api.api.API.search) provided by the SDK.
        1. Deserialize the retrieved data into a new Project node using the [`load_nodes_from_json`](../../utility_functions/#cript.nodes.util.load_nodes_from_json) utility function.
        1. Replace your old Project node with the new one in your script for accurate and up-to-date information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        node: UUIDBaseNode
            The node that you want to delete

        Raises
        ------
        APIError
            If the API responds with anything other than HTTP status 200, then the CRIPT Python SDK raises `APIError`
            `APIError` is raised in case the API cannot delete the specified node.
            Such cases can happen if you do not have permission to delete the node
            or if the node is actively being used elsewhere in CRIPT platform and the API cannot delete it.

        Returns
        -------

               You can also call `api.delete_node_by_uuid()` with
               ```python
               api.delete(
