        !!! note "api client context manager"
            It is necessary to use a `with` context manager for the API

        Examples
        --------
        ### Create API client with host and token
        >>> import cript
        >>> with cript.API(
        ...     host="https://api.criptapp.org/",
        ...     api_token=os.getenv("CRIPT_TOKEN"),

        ... ) as api:
        ...    # node creation, api.save(), etc.
        ...    pass


        ---

        ### Creating API Client
        !!! Warning "Token Security"
            It is **highly** recommended that you store your API tokens in a safe location and read it into your code
            Hard-coding API tokens directly into the code can pose security risks,
            as the token might be exposed if the code is shared or stored in a version control system.
            Anyone that has access to your tokens can impersonate you on the CRIPT platform

        ### Create API Client with Environment Variables

        Another great way to keep sensitive information secure is by using
        [environment variables](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-env-vars-how-to-get-an-environment-variable-in-python/).
        Sensitive information can be securely stored in environment variables and loaded into the code using
        [os.getenv()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv).

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import cript
        >>> import os
        >>> # securely load sensitive data into the script
        >>> cript_host = os.getenv("cript_host")
        >>> cript_api_token = os.getenv("cript_api_token")
        >>> cript_storage_token = os.getenv("cript_storage_token")
        >>> with cript.API(
        ...     host=cript_host, api_token=cript_api_token, storage_token=cript_storage_token
        ... ) as api:
        ...     pass

        ### Create API Client with None
        Alternatively you can configure your system to have an environment variable of
        `CRIPT_TOKEN` for the API token and `CRIPT_STORAGE_TOKEN` for the storage token, then
        initialize `cript.API` `api_token` and `storage_token` with `None`.

        The CRIPT Python SDK will try to read the API Token and Storage token from your system's environment variables.

        ```python
        with cript.API(host=cript_host, api_token=None, storage_token=None) as api:
            # write your script
            pass
        ```

        ### Create API client with config.json
        `config.json`
        ```json
        {
            "host": "https://api.criptapp.org/",
            "api_token": "I am API token",
            "storage_token": "I am storage token"
        }
        ```

        Examples
        --------
        `my_script.py`
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> import cript
        >>> # create a file path object of where the config file is
        >>> config_file_path = Path(__file__) / Path('./config.json')
        >>> with cript.API(config_file_path=config_file_path) as api:   # doctest: +SKIP
        ...     # node creation, api.save(), etc.
        ...     pass

        Parameters
        ----------
        host : str, None
            CRIPT host for the Python SDK to connect to such as https://api.criptapp.org/`
            This host address is the same address used to login to cript website.
            If `None` is specified, the host is inferred from the environment variable `CRIPT_HOST`.
        api_token : str, None
            CRIPT API Token used to connect to CRIPT and upload all data with the exception to file upload that needs
            a different token.
            You can find your personal token on the cript website at User > Security Settings.
            The user icon is in the top right.
            If `None` is specified, the token is inferred from the environment variable `CRIPT_TOKEN`.
        storage_token: str
            This token is used to upload local files to CRIPT cloud storage when needed
        config_file_path: str
            the file path to the config.json file where the token and host can be found


        Notes
        -----
        * if `host=None` and `token=None`
            then the Python SDK will grab the host from the users environment variable of `"CRIPT_HOST"`
            and `"CRIPT_TOKEN"`

        Warns
        -----
        UserWarning
            If `host` is using "http" it gives the user a warning that HTTP is insecure and the user should use HTTPS

        Notes
        -----
        We recommend using a [Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) object for specifying a file path.
        Using the Python [pathlib library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) provides platform-agnostic approach
        for filesystem operations, ensuring seamless functionality across different operating systems.
        Additionally, [Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) objects offer various built-in methods
        for more sophisticated and secure file handling and has a easy to use interface that can make working with it a breeze
        and can help reduce errors.

        Other options include using a raw string for relative/absolute file path,
        or using the [os.path module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html).


        Raises
        ------
        FileNotFoundError
            In case the CRIPT Python SDK cannot find the file on your computer because the file does not exist
            or the path to it is incorrect it raises
            [FileNotFoundError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError)

        Download a file from CRIPT Cloud Storage (AWS S3) and save it to the specified path.

        ??? Info "Cloud Storage vs Web URL File Download"

            If the `object_name` does not starts with `http` then the program assumes the file is in AWS S3 storage,
            and attempts to retrieve it via
            [boto3 client](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

            If the `object_name` starts with `http` then the program knows that
            it is a file stored on the web. The program makes a simple
            [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) request to get the file,
            then writes the contents of it to the specified destination.

            > Note: The current version of the program is designed to download files from the web in a straightforward
            manner. However, please be aware that the program may encounter limitations when dealing with URLs that
            require JavaScript or a session to be enabled. In such cases, the download method may fail.

            > We acknowledge these limitations and plan to enhance the method in future versions to ensure compatibility
            with a wider range of web file URLs. Our goal is to develop a robust solution capable of handling any and
            all web file URLs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_source: str
            `object_name`: file downloaded via object_name from cloud storage and saved to local storage
            object_name e.g. `"Data/{file_name}"`
            ---
            `URL file source`: If the file source starts with `http` then it is downloaded via `GET` request and

            > If no path is specified, then by default it will download the file
            to the current working directory.

            > The destination path must include a file name and file extension
