We value the collaborative spirit of the open-source community and would love to have your contributions.
This document outlines the guidelines to help you get started.
For more detailed information, please refer to our wiki section.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository [develop branch](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK/tree/develop) to your GitHub
   account.
   > [main branch](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK/tree/main) tries to mirror the CRIPT Pypi package,
   > [develop branch](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK/tree/develop) has all the latest developments waiting
   > for release
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository. Choose a descriptive name that summarizes your contribution.
3. Make the necessary changes or additions to the codebase.
4. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they don't introduce any issues.
5. Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
6. Push the changes to your forked repository.
7. Open a pull request (PR) in our repository to propose your changes.
   > Please be sure to merge all incoming changes to the
   > [develop branch](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK/tree/develop), we only update the
   > [main branch](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK/tree/main) when going to make a release by
   > merging [develop branch](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK/tree/develop) into main.
   > For more information, please refer to
   > [repository guidelines wiki](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/Python-SDK/wiki/Repository-Guidelines)

## Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists, and the
discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it. In
order to reproduce bugs, we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom
issue template. Please stick to the issue template.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate/fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear
back from you, we may close the issue.

## Submitting PR

Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You
don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR,
go ahead.

## PR Guidelines

When submitting a pull request, please make sure to:

- Clearly describe the purpose of your PR.
- Include any relevant information or context that helps us understand your changes.
- Make sure your changes adhere to our coding style and guidelines.
- Test your changes thoroughly and provide any necessary documentation or test cases.
- Ensure your PR does not include any unrelated or unnecessary changes.
- All CI must pass before a PR can be approved and merged into the code base.
