    This page shows the steps to acquiring an API Token to connect to the [CRIPT platform](https://criptapp.org)

<br/>

The token is needed because we need to authenticate the user before saving any of their data

2. Click on the **copy** button next to the API Token to copy it to clipboard
3. Now you can paste it into the `API Token` field

> Note: The "Token" in front of the random characters is part of the token as well
